** browserify
- made to "run node code in the browser"
- designed to run with nodejs
- other functionalities are added through plugins and transforms
** webpack
- designed to manage assets
- large core designed for that vs. small core of browserify
** Opinions
- if we're just going for static asset handling, go with webpack
- especially if we're not pulling in a lot of nodejs modules
- webpack's large core may be enough for our needs (the big question)
** Verdict
- webpack fits our needs, if we're OK with just static asset management.
